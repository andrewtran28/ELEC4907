CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.

Extraction called for design 'router' of instances=2018 and nets=2067 using extraction engine 'preRoute' .
**WARN: (ENCEXT-3530):	Use of command 'setDesignMode -process <process_node>' prior to extraction is recommended for maximum accuracy and optimal automatic threshold setting.
PreRoute RC Extraction called for design router.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (ENCEXT-6197):	Capacitance table file not specified. This would result in lower parasitic accuracy using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'.

The message limit can be removed by using the unsetMessageLimit command.
Note that setting a very large number using the setMessageLimit command
or removing the message limit using the unsetMessageLimit command can
significantly increase the log file size.

If the OA library being created is to be used for interoperability with Virtuoso version 6.1.5, SiP Layout 16.5, or other applications that have not been updated to support compressed databases, please set 'setOaxMode -compressLevel 0' before creating this library. Otherwise, using the library in those tools will require oazip to be run on the created library.
