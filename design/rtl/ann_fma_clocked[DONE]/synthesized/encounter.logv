CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.

CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.

Extraction called for design 'fma_top' of instances=1967 and nets=2058 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'low' .
**WARN: (ENCEXT-3530):	Use of command 'setDesignMode -process <process_node>' prior to extraction is recommended for maximum accuracy and optimal automatic threshold setting.
PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design fma_top.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (ENCEXT-6197):	Capacitance table file not specified. This would result in lower parasitic accuracy using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the capacitance table file using 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction.
